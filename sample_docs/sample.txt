            It contains multiple paragraphs to demonstrate document chunking.
            
            The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach combines the power
            of information retrieval with language generation. This allows AI systems
            to access and use specific information from a knowledge base when
            generating responses.
            
            Vector databases like FAISS enable efficient similarity search over
            high-dimensional embeddings, making it possible to quickly find
            relevant document chunks for any given query.
